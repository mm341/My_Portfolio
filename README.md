Portofolio Website
About
This is actually the second Version of my Portofolio. They both look identical with the exception of some minor layout and animation changes. The main diference comes in the technologies used. The first one was build with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript (If you wish to view the previous version you can visit this link). For this version remade the majority of the portofolio with React instead. All of the sections are split into components as well as the Navigation Bar and the Footer. Then some parts of some sections are also made into components for easier managment and for reusability purposes. For some of the animations I used the React AOS library and for others I just used plain CSS.
